# Shell Tooling

Welcome to the shell-tooling repo! Here lies a collection of bash aliases and scripts that are as fun to use as their names suggest.

## What’s Inside?

### `grabout`
Need to grab the last command input/output and shoot it straight to your clipboard? `grabout` is your go-to. Think of it as your error message whisperer, perfect for faster AI-driven automation workflows. Say goodbye to manually copying error messages like it’s the 90s.

### `linusfiles`
Ever felt like Linus Torvalds himself while working across multiple files in a git repo? Well, now you can, minus the beard. `linusfiles` lists files tracked by git and copies their content directly to your clipboard, saving you the hassle of copying and pasting into your favorite LLM. It’s like having a personal assistant, only nerdier.
